# Preliminary Proposal
## Proposal 1 (I know I can get the data)

### High-level description of the project.

The purpose of this project will be using machine learning to predict the US Natural Gas prices. I will be using supply and demand data including the Hery Hub Natural Gas spot price, US weather averages (daily), US Natural Gas reserves (annually), Import & Exports (Monthly), and storage data (weekly) for the last 30 years.
### What question or problem are you trying to solve?

I would like to predict spot prices for the commodity and ETFs following the commodity. 

### How will you present your work?

- Visualization
- Presentation - slides

### What are your data sources?
- For the Hery Hub Natural Gas spot price, US Natural Gas reserves (annually), Import & Exports (Monthly), and storage data (weekly), I will be using csv data from the US Energy Information Administration website. https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/
- For the ETFs, I will be using data from the Alpha Vantage API. https://www.alphavantage.co/
- For the US weather averages (daily), I will use the NOAA database. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/

### Whatâ€™s your next step towards making this your project.
- Probably getting the data.
