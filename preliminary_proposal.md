# Preliminary Proposal
## Proposal 1 (I know I can get the data)

### High-level description of the project.

The purpose of this project will be using machine learning to predict the US Natural Gas prices. I will be using supply and demand data including the Hery Hub Natural Gas spot price, US weather averages (daily), US Natural Gas reserves (annually), Import & Exports (Monthly), and storage data (weekly) for the last 30 years.
### What question or problem are you trying to solve?

I would like to predict spot prices for the commodity and ETFs following the commodity. 

### How will you present your work?

- Visualization
- Presentation - slides

### What are your data sources?
- For the Hery Hub Natural Gas spot price, US Natural Gas reserves (annually), Import & Exports (Monthly), and storage data (weekly), I will be using csv data from the US Energy Information Administration website. https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/
- For the ETFs, I will be using data from the Alpha Vantage API. https://www.alphavantage.co/
- For the US weather averages (daily), I will use the NOAA database. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/

### What’s your next step towards making this your project.
- Probably getting the data.

## Proposal 2 (I think I can get the data)

### High-level description of the project.

The purpose of this project will be using machine learning to predict the outcome of UFC fights. This will be a continuation of my previous mini-capstone where I collected fighters data and did some basic EDA work. This time I would like to I include fighters background skills.

### What question or problem are you trying to solve?

What combination of skills are more likely to win UFC fights and predict performance against another particular set of skills. The background skill information is not easily available for most fighters. So, would probably use all the background skill available and develop a categorical machine learning to predict fighters background as my first step. 

### How will you present your work?

- Visualization
- Presentation - slides

### What are your data sources?

- For general fighters and fight statistics, I will use the UFC stats website. http://ufcstats.com
- For fighters background, I will be using Wikipedia. 

### What’s your next step towards making this your project.
- Probably getting the data.

## Proposal 3 (Maybe I can get the data)


### High-level description of the project.

The purpose of this project will be using machine learning to predict the acres price for oil and gas development in the Denver-Julesburg Basin. 

### What question or problem are you trying to solve?

Currently, there is not a quantitative way to determine how much to pay for mineral rights royalties in the oil and gas industry. It is mostly through gut feelings and knowledge on how much other people had paid for similar deals. I would like to create a quantitative way of assessing properties values using formation thickness, pipeline access, nearby well production, and sweet spot estimations.  

The data needed for this project will include formation top and bottoms, well production, pressure data, oil/gas ratios, TOC content, pipeline maps, and previous deals information.

### How will you present your work?

- Visualization
- Presentation - slides

### What are your data sources?

- Most of this data can come from the United State Geological Survey API. https://www.usgs.gov/
- For the pipeline maps, I will be US Energy Information Administration website. https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/. 

### What’s your next step towards making this your project.

- Probably getting the data.
